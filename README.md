OSHw1 : Say Hello to The System~!<br>
In this assignment, you would learn to write a console program with various system APIs and provide a Makefile configuration to compile, clean & test your project. This project would include 2 program (master.out & mmv.out)) The first one would fork a child proc. to exec 2nd one to copy and manipulate input file...Please refer to the instructions in the class<br>

OSHw2 : the Q&A puzzle An assignment to train your presentation. ! <br>
Goal:
To improve your ability to present and answer questions, for this assignment you will be asked to write a report answering the following questions. The report should contain a detailed description of the problem (how it occurred) and the current solution in the operating system (with hardware support), with examples of code write by yourself. Answers to the questions can be found in books and on the internet, but do not copy and paste them directly into a translation tool and don't use their sentence directly too (plagiarism). It is expected that approximately two pages of A4 and multiple pages of a slides will be required to answer this question and the results of this assignment will be quite subjective.<br>

OSHw3 : Pork Zongzi maker! 歡樂包粽機 A homework of making a parallel production line ! <br>
In this assignment, we will move from a problem dealing with the communication of messages between multiple processes to a multi-thread data exchange and synchronisation problem. We will also extend this to a multi-step Consumer-Producer thread problem, and you will need concepts such as threads from Chapter 4, task synchronisation and deadlock management from Chapters 6 to 8 to implement the whole assignment. You will learn the following things in this assignment.
1. the basic use of PThread, data sharing between threads, and solving problems with data sharing
2. the use and design of Mutex and (Counting) Semaphore (you may also use the idea of Monitor)
3. how to manage queues and queuing problems, and prevent Deadlock from getting stuck<br>
